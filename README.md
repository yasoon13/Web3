# Web3
## Introduction
This repository is created to log my web3 journey. It includes resources I used, videos I watched, tools and software I learned and other things that I cannot think right now.
<br />
<br /> In this journey, what I figured out is that I need to learn the following:
1. Javascript
2. Typecript (Basically, you learn javascript and within few hours you'll master typescript)
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Python
6. Prompt engineering
7. Github
<br />
<br /> I will create separate .md files for the above. Why I'm doing this on Github? Because I just love it here! Also there is a chance that more files will also be added here.
<br />
<br /> Also I'm using:
<br /> 1) [Markdown Language](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and;
<br /> 2) [MarkdownLivePreview](https://markdownlivepreview.com) to learn and write this readme.md file. It's pretty insane!

## Roadmap
1. The basic framework is this:
   * Master Web 2.0
   * Get Web 2.0 projects
   * Master Web 3.0
   * Get Web 3.0 projects
2. Begin with learning Javascript because there are more videos on Javascript than Typescript. The goal is to get on-board with Typescript because we want to do large scale projects.
3. While learning Javascript, sign-up on Github and understand how Git and Github works because you want to not only write code and make projects, but also share them publically to show your skills and make a portfolio for work or collaboration opportunities.
