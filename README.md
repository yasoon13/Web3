# Web3
This repository is created to log my web3 journey. It includes resources I used, videos I watched, tools and software I learned and other things that I cannot think right now.
<br />
<br /> In this journey, what I figured out is that I need to learn the following:
1. Javascript
2. Typecript (Basically, you learn javascript and within few hours you'll master typescript)
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Python
6. Prompt engineering
7. Github
<br />
<br /> I will create separate .md files for the above. Why I'm doing this on Github? Because I just love it here! Also there is a chance that more files will also be added here.
