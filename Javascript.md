# How to learn Javascript
<br /> Best video to learn Javascript [Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=3751s) if you know a little a bit about programming and just want to understand the syntax of the programming language.
<br /> Another video is this one -- [JavaScript Programming - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M). I haven't really watched it because it's a 7+ hours video, but I think it can help someone with zero programming experience.
<br /> If you're interested in computer science and programming and want to start from the very beginning, then I recommend: 1) [Harvard CS50 – Full Computer Science University Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and then 2) [Harvard CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript – Full University Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzGllw18DkA&t=10781s)
<br /> Ps. I have watched snippets of it but they are really good videos to check out.
